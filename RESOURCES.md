Category 4: Event Mini-Game
What to Build
You are a Game Developer tasked by Cloud9 and JetBrains to create a fun, engaging, and fast-paced mini-game for fans. Your game will be the main attraction at a booth during a major LCS or VCT event.

Your game needs to be easy to pick up, fun to play, and capture the excitement of esports! It must be something a fan can play in just a few minutes while waiting in line or visiting the booth. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.

Game Requirements
Your game could perform the following core functions or meet these design goals.

Be Fast & Engaging: A single play session should be quick, ideally under 3 minutes. The goal is "high replayability."

Be Intuitive & Accessible: Use simple controls (e.g., mouse-only, arrow keys, single-button) that anyone can understand instantly with no tutorial.

Be Thematic: The game could be thematically related to the Cloud9 brand or the JetBrains brand. It could also be based around the esports titles of League of Legends or VALORANT; however, this is not a requirement.

How can you take it to the next level?

Implement a Live Leaderboard: Create a dynamic "high score" list that can be displayed on a screen at the event booth, driving competition among fans.

You have the freedom to develop the project in any direction you consider valuable and exciting, leveraging your creative ideas to bring it to life.

Demonstration Prompts & Submission
Your submission (in your video and/or a live demo) must clearly demonstrate a full, playable gameplay loop. The following outputs are examples only, intended to illustrate the type of game you could create. Hackers have the freedom to and are welcome to let the creative juices flow!

Main Prompt: Gameplay Showcase
Task: "Your video submission must clearly demonstrate a full gameplay loop. Show a user starting the game, playing it, and reaching a 'Game Over' or 'Score' screen."

Example (VALORANT Theme): "Junie's Site Retake"

Concept: A 2D, mouse-only game. You control the JetBrains "Junie" mascot. Enemy utility (e.g., Viper Orb, Killjoy grenade, Cypher tripwire) appears on a site. You must click to "debug" (remove) the enemy utility while avoiding clicking on friendly C9 player abilities. Score is based on speed and accuracy.
