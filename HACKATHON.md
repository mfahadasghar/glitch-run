Welcome to Sky’s the Limit - Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon
Cloud9 is bringing its competitive spirit from the arena to the dev world—with a global hackathon built to ignite creativity, sharpen skills, and bring bold ideas to life. As one of the most storied organizations in esports, Cloud9 is known for championship rosters, fierce innovation, and a community that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible. Whether you’re a gamer, a builder, or a curious creator, this is your chance to level up alongside a team that never stops evolving.

In this hackathon, entrants will build or update a working application using the tools of their choice—plus optional support from JetBrains’ AI Coding Agent, Junie. Junie can help accelerate your workflow and unlock new ways to create, but the real spotlight is on you and the ideas you bring to the table.

With exclusive resources like official esports data for League of Legends and VALORANT provided by GRID, expert guidance, and a prize pool that rewards innovation, this is your arena. Pick a category, lock in, and show Cloud9 what you can build.

Requirements
What to Build

Entrants must build or update a working application that uses JetBrains IDEs and Junie and submit it into one of the following categories:

Category 1 - A comprehensive Assistant Coach powered by Data Science and AI: that merges micro-level player analytics with macro-level strategic review. Inspired by Moneyball (Jonah Hill’s Peter Brand), this near-real-time application analyzes historical match data to provide a holistic and actionable review. The platform crunches the numbers to identify recurring individual mistakes and connects them directly to their impact on team-wide macro strategy, generating targeted insights for coaches and players.

Category 2 - Automated Scouting Report Generator: An application that, given an upcoming opponent, automatically scours GRID data from their recent matches to generate a concise scouting report. The report would highlight common strategies, player tendencies, and default site setups (for VAL), or recently played comps (for LoL & VAL).

Category 3 - AI Drafting Assistant/Drafting Predictor (LoL): Develop a tool that analyzes historical GRID data (team compositions, player champion/agent pools, win rates, champion synergies, patch data, recent games history) to recommend optimal draft strategies, picks, and bans against specific opponents in real-time during the pick/ban phase.

Category 4 - Event Game: Develop a mini-game that can be played by fans at a LCS or VCT Event Booth or Finals Activation. The winning project will be integrated into a future Cloud9 & JetBrains Event Booth.
Please read through the Submission Specifics page for full details.
